    "NetworkX is a Python library designed to work with network structures and graphs. It's used to create, manipulate, analyze, and visualize networks and graphs efficiently. NetworkX provides tools for creating a variety of network types, ranging from simple graphs to directed and weighted graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some key functionalities of NetworkX include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Graph Creation: NetworkX allows you to create different types of graphs, including undirected graphs, directed graphs, multigraphs, and weighted graphs. Nodes and edges (or connections) can have associated attributes.\n",
    "- Graph Manipulation: You can add and remove nodes and edges, modify attributes of nodes and edges, and perform various operations on graphs, such as subsetting, combining, and copying.\n",
    "- Graph Analysis: The library provides a variety of algorithms and metrics for analyzing graphs. You can calculate properties such as node centrality, shortest paths, connectivity, and clustering, among others.\n",
    "- Graph Visualization: NetworkX also includes tools for effectively visualizing graphs. You can create visual plots to represent your networks and gain a better understanding of their structure.\n",
    "- Graph Algorithms: NetworkX implements various popular graph algorithms, such as search algorithms, network flow algorithms, shortest path algorithms, and more.\n",
    "- Integration with other libraries: NetworkX is compatible with other Python data analysis and visualization libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib, enabling smooth integration into larger data analysis workflows.\n",
